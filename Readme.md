This project is an emulator of the chip-8 language.
After launching the program, you must enter the name of the floppy disk with the extension ".ch8" into the console. After that, the selected disk will start. To run another program without leaving the emulator, you need to press "R", then re-enter the ROM name.
The keys from the keyboard are directly translated to the emulator (i.e. 1 -> 0x1, A -> 0xA, and so on).
